This is the code repository for [Hands-On Gradient Boosting with XGBoost and scikit-learn](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-gradient-boosting-with-xgboost-and-scikit-learn/9781839218354), published by Packt.

**Perform accessible machine learning and extreme gradient boosting with Python**

## What is this book about?
XGBoost is an industry-proven, open-source software library that provides a gradient boosting framework for scaling billions of data points quickly and efficiently.

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Build machine learning bagging and boosting models
* Develop XGBoost regressors and classifiers with impressive accuracy and speed
* Find out how to analyze variance and bias in machine learning
* Compare XGBoostâ€™s results to decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting
* Visualize tree-based models and use machine learning to determine the most important features of a dataset

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
X_bikes = df_bikes.iloc[:,:-1]
y_bikes = df_bikes.iloc[:,-1]
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_bikes,
y_bikes, random_state=2)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data science professionals and enthusiasts, data analysts, and developers who want to build fast and accurate machine learning models that scale with big data. Proficiency in Python, along with a basic understanding of linear algebra, will help you to get the most out of this book..

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
